- You can head over to https://github.com/SIMKL/Sync-Simkl-to-Plex-Chrome-Extension
- Download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SIMKL/Sync-Simkl-to-Plex-Chrome-Extension/releases)
- Unzip if downloaded the zip
- Go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode if you haven't already did.
- Then you can load unpacked and select the extracted zip directory
- You can now try out the extension, see if any UX or UI bugs exist ( report via github issues, or dm me on discord if you don't have a github account)
- You may also suggest any UX improvements (open a github issue)
- _Note:_ As of now your plex library will not get affected in anyway if you run the sync.
- Open the devtools console tab and look out for any errors, see if your simkl media which are **also** available in the plex library all show up in the console after sync is enabled.
- You can optionally enable debug logs in devtools (in console tab > default levels) we might ask you for them if you report any errors.
- _Note:_ Just reminding agin, It won't sync right now, it is only a dry run. Sync is disabled.
